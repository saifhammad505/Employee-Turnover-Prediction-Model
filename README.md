# Employee-Turnover-Prediction-Model

Project Description:

Employee turnover can be a significant challenge for businesses. However, with the power of data science and machine learning, we can predict and mitigate employee attrition effectively.

Project Overview:

I have completed a data science project focused on predicting employee turnover using a Random Forest Classifier. This project leverages a dataset similar to the one provided in the example, including features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, number of projects, salary, and more.

What I Have Accomplished:

    Data Preprocessing: I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, Duplicates and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for modeling.

    Model Selection: I chose the Random Forest Classifier for its robustness and ability to handle complex data relationships. I implemented the classifier, trained the model to achieve optimal results. Hyper tuning wasn't performed because of models good performance.

    Evaluation Metrics: To assess the model's performance, I used a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more. This ensures the model's reliability and effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

    Feature Importance: I analyzed feature importance to provide insights into the key factors influencing employee attrition. Understanding these factors can help organizations take proactive measures to retain valuable employees.

    Visualization: To make the project visually appealing and insightful, I created stunning data visualizations, including a 3D scatter plot and a pie chart with data labels.

I am available to discuss the project in more detail, answer any questions you may have, and explore opportunities for deployment in your organization.
