# Employee-Turnover-Prediction-Model

Project Description:

Are you struggling to retain valuable talent in your organization? Employee turnover can be a significant challenge for businesses. However, with the power of data science and machine learning, we can predict and mitigate employee attrition effectively.

Project Overview:

I have completed a data science project focused on predicting employee turnover using a Random Forest Classifier. This project leverages a dataset similar to the one provided in the example, including features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, number of projects, salary, and more.

What I Have Accomplished:

    Data Preprocessing: I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, Duplicates and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for modeling.

    Model Selection: I chose the Random Forest Classifier for its robustness and ability to handle complex data relationships. I implemented the classifier, trained the model to achieve optimal results. Hyper tuning wasn't performed because of models good performance.

    Evaluation Metrics: To assess the model's performance, I used a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more. This ensures the model's reliability and effectiveness in predicting employee turnover.

    Feature Importance: I analyzed feature importance to provide insights into the key factors influencing employee attrition. Understanding these factors can help organizations take proactive measures to retain valuable employees.

    Visualization: To make the project visually appealing and insightful, I created stunning data visualizations, including a 3D scatter plot and a pie chart with data labels.

I am available to discuss the project in more detail, answer any questions you may have, and explore opportunities for deployment in your organization. Together, we can leverage data-driven insights to create a more engaged and productive workforce.

If you're ready to take control of employee turnover and unlock the potential of your organization, let's connect and discuss how this project can benefit you.
